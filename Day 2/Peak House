// Peak House
// There is a society in Gurgaon where everyone thinks that they have a taller house than their neighbors.  
// Consider all the house are in the same line, so everyone will have two neighbors on their left and right except the 
// corner ones who have just one neighbor. Now you are given 
// the task of giving the position of one such house which satisfies this condition of being taller than their neighbors.
